# How to Edit Topics and Sub-Topics in Application Security (data.json)

Use this file to learn how to add, remove, or edit topics and sub-topics within the "Application Security" section of your mind map.

---

## 1. Add a New Main Topic (under Application Security)
Paste a new object inside the "children" array of "Application Security" (after the last main topic, but before the closing brackets):

```json
{
  "name": "Application Security",
  "children": [
    ...existing main topics...
    {
      "name": "New Main Topic",
      "description": "A description for the new topic.",
      "children": [
        { "name": "Sub-Topic X", "description": "Details for X" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 2. Add a New Sub-Topic
Paste a new object inside any main topic's "children" array (after the last sub-topic, but before the closing brackets):

```json
{
  "name": "Threat Modeling",
  "children": [
    ...existing sub-topics...
    { "name": "Sub-Topic G", "description": "Details for G" }
  ]
}
```

---

## 3. Add More Fields to Any Node
Add new fields (like "icon", "link") to any node object:

```json
{ "name": "Sub-Topic H", "description": "Details for H", "icon": "ðŸ”’", "link": "https://example.com" }
```

---

If you need to remove a topic or sub-topic, simply delete its object from the array.
